Discord bot that checks the status/information for a crypto transaction id

The bot only supports BTC transactions at the moment and doesn't work for all transaction types. I built it so it listens for certain things and this may not work for you. You may need to edit some things but for me it works. 

To run the bot all you need to do is install pycord

 `pip install py-cord` and you are ready to go. And add your bot token at the bottom!
